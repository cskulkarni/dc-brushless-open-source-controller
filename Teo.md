# Preamble #

With electric vehicles getting clearly and clearly the future of personal mobility the interest of tech-savvy people about them is getting bigger and bigger.
Since electric vehicle and components are still very expensive, DIY is an enormous opportunity for people to learn about this techonology.
Tho, some aspects of electric power devices can be a little less intuitive to understand and require more of a mental effort than theis oil-powered counterpart.
One of the most complicate part of EVs are motor controllers,
this project aims at making a cheap but still very powerful motor controller, to be used with BLDC motors of any sort (initial design is aimed to big model aircraft outrunnes up to 10kW.

This project was started by Ludo91 (belgxx@hotmail.it), who searching for infos about bldc controllers found an awesome group of people willing to share their knowledge at endless-sphere.com. The knowledge sharing is what made possible to go from none to a first prototype in less than 3 months, this is why now this projects wants to get even more people to contribute, discussing this recent project and sharing their experiences from previous DIY controllers projects.
